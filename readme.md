<h3>Location Map</h3>

<p>
This map shows <a href="https://www.southernliving.com/travel/north-carolina/north-carolina-christmas-tree-farms" target="_blank">Southern Living Magazine's</a> choices of the best christmas tree farms in North Carolina. The map provides a static image of the beginning of the article and includes a link to the rest of the article. The point markers were obtained from Google Maps, which was converted into a GeoJSON file. Within the JSON file the name, city, state, websire url, and an image of each christmas tree farm listed in the magazine article is included. Leaflet, Javascript, CSS, and FontAwesome libraries were used for creating the map layers and popup actions. The popup function used .binPopup and it included all the fields listed in the GeoJSON file. The first click opens the popup and the second click will take you to the website of the XMas tree farm. The fonts and styling of the elements were also chosen to fit with the styling of the Southern Living website.
